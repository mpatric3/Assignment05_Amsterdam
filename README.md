	Choreography of the site:
		The user will begin on the home page, which gives a general overview of the website content. 
		From this page, the user can navigate to the other two pages of the website, "Uses" and "Development." 

		The central goal of the website is to get website visitors to fill-out a survey that is related to the topic of fruit. 
		For this reason, the HTML form for the survey is located at the bottom of the site, and justified to the right.

## Information Architect: Meghan Patrick
Gathered information from Wikipedia about fruit. Created HTML template, and included images and link to outside source.

### Ontology:
		
The central theme of this site is fruit, so all fonts and colors should communicate a fun and bright fruity vibe. The domain and structure of this site are the importance of the fruit logo (to be made by the designer), the fruit title, and fruit pictures on the main page, and the section headings and pictures on the following two page. Each page contains a central heading, followed by two sections of secondary headings with equally spaced content. One image is included per page to demonstrate the concept.

The sections are purposefully structured in the same way, with a fruit title, fruit content, and fruit image.

### Choreography: 
The choreography is defined by the F layout on each page, made by the fruit logo, title, navigation, and then fruit content. 

The primary goal of this website is to fill-out the survey. This is why it is important that the survey is located at the bottom right of the homepage.

		Once the user fills out this survey, they are redirected to the page "thanks.php" which gives
		a brief thank you message, and provides the navigation necessary to return to the three central pages of the website.

		For the admin controls, a login form is located at the bottom of the home page. If the user does not have an account (if
		they are not an admin) they can click a link to register, which redirects them to "register.php" where they can fill out
		a form and become an admin.
		Once logged in, they are redirected to welcome.php. The purpose of this page is to be able to view and edit (insert/delete)
		the survey responses of normal, non-admin users on the site.

	Ontology of the site:
		Content for the site was collected from Wikipedia, including images.
		The structure of the site begins with the three pages of central content, linked through the navigation menu. Each page contains
		a central heading, with two subheadings and related content.

		For the designer, the intended mood of the site is whimsical with citris colors (red, orange, yellow, green) to convey the content. Fonts should be chosen to be clear and fun to read. The intended layout is a banner with a site logo and title on the left, and navigation on the right. 
		The content should be left justified, with a large central heading and smaller subheadings. The survey should be at the bottom right of the home page since it is the primary goal, and extenuated with color to draw the user's attention.
=======
### Intended layout: 
Header with logo and title on the left, and navigation on the right. Content with a central title, and secondary titles for content. Survey should be at the bottom right of the home page since it is the primary goal.

### Intented mood/feeling: 
Bright and fun fruity colors (red, orange, yellow, green) that reflect the colors included in the photos. Whimsical fonts to reflect the mood of the content.

### Intended interactivity: 
The survey should ask users to login in and report what their favorite fruit is.
