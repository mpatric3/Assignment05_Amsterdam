Assignment 5


Information Architect: Meghan Patrick
	Gathered information from Wikipedia about fruit. Created HTML template, and included images and link to outside source.

	Ontology:
		The domain and structure of this site are the importance of the logo, title, and pictures on the main page, and the section headings and pictures on the following two page. Each page contains a central heading, followed by two sections of secondary headings with equally spaced content. One image is included per page to demonstrate the concept.

		The sections are purposefully structured in the same way, with a title, content, and image.
	Choreography: 
		The choreography is defined by the F layout on the fact page. This is described in more detail below, but the central content in the title on the homepage and the logo, title, and content section titles on the fact page.

		The form is purposefully presented at the END of the veggie page because it is an optional activity the user can participate in after reading the content and being excited about exploring the world of veggies.


Intended layout of each page from a high-level (think: wireframes and sketches) so the designer can execute the layout in CSS
Intended mood/feeling of the website so the designer can execute the formatting including typeface choices, color choices and other embellishments
Intended interactivity (especially in regard to the survey, the login system, and the database functions) to be executed by the coder (keep in mind: you can’t ask the coder to do really complex things if they’re not capable of such things! - keep it realistic - talk to each other!)
