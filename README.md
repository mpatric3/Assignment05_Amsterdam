Information Architect: Meghan Patrick
	Gathered information from Wikipedia about fruit. Created HTML template, and included images and link to outside source.

	Ontology:
		The central theme of this site is fruit, so all fonts and colors should communicate a fun and bright fruity vibe. The domain and structure of this site are the importance of the fruit logo (to be made by the designer), the fruit title, and fruit pictures on the main page, and the section headings and pictures on the following two page. Each page contains a central heading, followed by two sections of secondary headings with equally spaced content. One image is included per page to demonstrate the concept.

		The sections are purposefully structured in the same way, with a fruit title, fruit content, and fruit image.

	Choreography: 
		The choreography is defined by the F layout on each page, made by the fruit logo, title, navigation, and then fruit content. 

		The primary goal of this website is to fill-out the survey. This is why it is important that the survey is located at the bottom right of the homepage.


Intended layout: Header with logo and title on the left, and navigation on the right. Content with a central title, and secondary titles for content. Survey should be at the bottom right of the home page since it is the primary goal.

Intented mood/feeling: Bright and fun fruity colors (red, orange, yellow, green) that reflect the colors included in the photos. Whimsical fonts to reflect the mood of the content.

Intended interactivity: The survey should ask users to login in and report what their favorite fruit is.
