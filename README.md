	Choreography of the site:
		The user will begin on the home page, which gives a general overview of the website content. 
		From this page, the user can navigate to the other two pages of the website, "uses.php" and "development.php"
		using the navigation bar located in the banner at the top of the page. 

		The central goal of the website is to get website visitors to fill-out a survey that is related to the topic of fruit. 
		For this reason, the HTML form for the survey is located at the bottom of the site, and justified to the right.
		The form is related to the theme of the site by being an email sign up for the fruit of the month club.

		Once the user fills out this survey, they are redirected to the page "thanks.php" which gives
		a brief thank you message, and provides the navigation necessary to return to the three central pages of the website.

		For the admin controls, a login form is located at the bottom of the home page, beneath the survey. It is not intended for typical
		users, so it is intended to be small and subtle. 

		If the user does not have an account (if they are not an admin) they can click a link to register, which redirects them to "register.php" where they can fill out a form and become an admin.
		
		Once logged in, they are redirected to welcome.php. The purpose of this page is to be able to view and edit (insert/delete)
		the survey responses of normal, non-admin users on the site.

	Ontology of the site:
		The structure of the site begins with the three pages of central content, linked through the navigation menu. Each page contains
		a central heading, with two subheadings and related content.

		The intended mood of the site is whimsical with citris colors (red, orange, yellow, green) to convey the content. Fonts should be clear and easy to read, conveying a whimsical and easy-going sense. The intended layout is a banner with a site logo and title on the left, and navigation on the right. 
		The content should be left justified, with a large central heading and smaller subheadings. The survey should be at the bottom right of the home page since it is the primary goal, and extenuated with color to draw the user's attention.

		Content for the site was collected from Wikipedia, including images.
