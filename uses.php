            <h3>Nutritional Value</h3>
            <p>Fresh fruits are generally high in fiber, vitamin C, and water.[33] Regular consumption of fruit is generally associated with reduced risks of several diseases and functional declines associated with aging.[34][35]
            </p>
            <p>Many hundreds of fruits, including fleshy fruits (like apple, kiwifruit, mango, peach, pear, and watermelon) are commercially valuable as human food, eaten both fresh and as jams, marmalade and other preserves. Fruits are also used in manufactured foods (e.g., cakes, cookies, ice cream, muffins, or yogurt) or beverages, such as fruit juices (e.g., apple juice, grape juice, or orange juice) or alcoholic beverages (e.g., brandy, fruit beer, or wine).[30] Fruits are also used for gift giving, e.g., in the form of Fruit Baskets and Fruit Bouquets.

            <p>Many "vegetables" in culinary parlance are botanical fruits, including bell pepper, cucumber, eggplant, green bean, okra, pumpkin, squash, tomato, and zucchini.[31] Olive fruit is pressed for olive oil. Spices like allspice, black pepper, paprika, and vanilla are derived from berries.[32]

            <h3>Nonfood Uses</h3>
            <p>Because fruits have been such a major part of the human diet, various cultures have developed many different uses for fruits they do not depend on for food.

Pumpkins are carved into Jack-o'-lanterns for Halloween. The spiny fruit of burdock or cocklebur inspired the invention of Velcro.[41] Coir fiber from coconut shells is used for brushes, doormats, floor tiles, insulation, mattresses, sacking, and as a growing medium for container plants.
